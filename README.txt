Referral System for WooCommerce. Each customer has referral link that rewards them with a coupon after someone makes a purchase through their link

== Description ==

Refer A Friend plugin will create a unique url for each of your WooCommerce members, that will be visible on their account page. Members can use that link to link to your products, and every time someone purchases something through their link, you will reward them with a coupon. Coupons are connected with WooCoupons so you can define value of each coupon, type, minimum order and can it be combined with other woo coupons. After order is marked as complete, coupon is sent to a person who referred you a customers. 
Every time referral receives a coupon, it will be shown in his account page and only he can use it.
